## üì§ Example Output

**From minimal prompt:**
```
SECURITY-TEST-001: SQL Injection - Login Form
**Severity:** Critical
**OWASP Category:** A03:2021 - Injection

**Attack Vector:**
Inject SQL commands through login form to bypass authentication

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter in username field: admin' OR '1'='1
3. Enter any password
4. Click submit
5. Observe response

**Expected Defense:**
- Input sanitization should block SQL syntax
- Parameterized queries should prevent injection
- Error message should not reveal SQL errors

**Indicators of Vulnerability:**
- Successful login without valid credentials
- SQL error messages displayed
- Database information leaked

**Remediation:**
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement input validation
- Apply principle of least privilege for DB user

SECURITY-TEST-002: Stored XSS - Comment Section
**Severity:** High
**OWASP Category:** A03:2021 - Injection

**Attack Vector:**
Inject malicious JavaScript in comment field that executes when viewed by other users

**Test Steps:**
1. Post comment with payload: <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
2. View comment as different user
3. Check if script executes

**Expected Defense:**
- Input sanitization removes script tags
- Output encoding prevents execution
- Content Security Policy blocks inline scripts

**Indicators of Vulnerability:**
- Alert box appears showing cookies
- Script executes in other users' browsers
- HTML source shows unescaped script tags

**Remediation:**
- Implement output encoding
- Use CSP headers
- Sanitize all user input

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Start with OWASP Top 10** - Cover most common vulnerabilities
2. **Prioritize by severity** - Critical issues first
3. **Test in safe environment** - Never test production without permission
4. **Document everything** - Include payloads and evidence
5. **Follow responsible disclosure** - Report vulnerabilities properly
6. **Get authorization** - Always have written permission
7. **Include remediation** - Help developers fix issues

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Legal Considerations:**
- Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure policies
- Be aware of legal consequences of unauthorized testing

**Ethical Testing:**
- Don't exfiltrate real data
- Don't cause damage or disruption
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Respect privacy and confidentiality

---

## ‚úÖ Security Testing Checklist

Before running security tests:
- [ ] Have written authorization to test
- [ ] Testing in appropriate environment (not production)
- [ ] Have backup/rollback plan
- [ ] Know escalation procedures for critical findings
- [ ] Documented test scope and boundaries
- [ ] Have secure channel for reporting vulnerabilities
